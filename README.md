# Code Snippet Manager

Because apparently Google Drive, GitHub Gists, Notion, and the 47 random .txt files on your desktop weren't enough places to lose your code snippets.

**Live Demo:** https://abhiraj7575.github.io/code-snippet-manager/

*Now you can hoard code snippets in your browser too!* 🎉

## What Fresh Hell Is This?

A browser-based snippet manager that stores everything in LocalStorage. You know, that thing you clear every time your browser acts weird? Yeah, that one.

Perfect for developers who:
- Copy-paste the same 5 functions across 20 projects
- Save snippets they'll "definitely use later" (narrator: they won't)
- Trust their browser more than they trust cloud storage
- Enjoy living dangerously

---

## Features (And Why They're Barely Useful)

**LocalStorage Persistence** 📦  
All snippets stored in your browser! Until you:
- Clear your cache
- Switch browsers
- Factory reset your laptop
- Incognito mode (oops, forgot about that)

Then it's all gone. Hope you weren't attached to that regex you finally got working.

**Real-time Search** 🔍  
Find that snippet you saved 6 months ago and never used! Search by title, language, or that one variable name you definitely remember... was it `userData` or `user_data`? Who knows!

**Auto-save** 💾  
Never manually save again! The app does it for you. Until your browser crashes mid-type and you lose everything anyway. But hey, at least we tried.

**Language Selection** 🌐  
Supports JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS, and more! All neatly organized by language you'll never filter by because you just search "that thing with the map function."

**Clipboard Integration** 📋  
One-click copy! Because `Ctrl+C` was too complicated. Now you can copy code you don't understand even faster!

**Responsive Design** 📱  
Works on mobile! So you can pretend to be productive while lying in bed at 2 AM, hoarding more snippets you'll never use.

**Keyboard Shortcuts** ⌨️  
- `Ctrl+S` - Save (even though it auto-saves)
- `Ctrl+N` - New snippet (more hoarding!)
- `Ctrl+Z` - Doesn't work (cry about it)

## Installation (Bold of You to Call It That)

```bash
# "Install" is a strong word for "download and open"
git clone https://github.com/your-username/code-snippet-manager.git
cd code-snippet-manager
open index.html

# Congratulations, you've "installed" a single HTML file
```

No build process. No dependencies. No dignity. Just raw HTML doing its thing like it's 2005.

---

## Built With

- **HTML5** - The bones
- **CSS3** - Dark mode because light mode is for sociopaths
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Zero frameworks, maximum regret
- **LocalStorage API** - Your data's worst enemy
- **Hope** - That you'll actually remember to export your snippets

---

## Usage (Or: How to Hoard Code)

1. **Click "+ New"** - Start collecting snippets like Pokémon cards
2. **Paste code** - That Stack Overflow answer you "wrote yourself"
3. **Select language** - Pretend organization matters
4. **Watch it auto-save** - To a storage that'll betray you eventually
5. **Never use it again** - The true developer experience
6. **Repeat** - Until you have 200 snippets and use 3

### Pro Tips

- Actually export your data occasionally (you won't)
- Don't clear your browser cache (you will)
- Use meaningful titles (you'll name everything "test" and "temp")
- Delete unused snippets (never gonna happen)

---

## The Reality Check

Let's be honest about what this really is:

**What you think you're building:**  
A curated library of essential code snippets, perfectly organized and frequently referenced.

**What you're actually building:**  
A digital junk drawer where that one CSS trick lives next to a half-finished API call you copied in 2023 and 47 variations of "hello world."

---

## Common Use Cases

✓ Saving regex patterns you Googled  
✓ Hoarding API boilerplate you'll never customize  
✓ Storing that one function that works (you don't know why)  
✓ Collecting CSS animations you saw on CodePen  
✓ Pretending you'll build a component library someday  
✓ Keeping code snippets instead of learning the concept

## FAQ Nobody Asked For

**Q: Why not use GitHub Gists?**  
A: Because I needed a weekend project and you need another place to lose code.

**Q: What happens if I clear my browser data?**  
A: Your snippets go to the same place as your childhood dreams - gone forever.

**Q: Can I export my data?**  
A: Technically yes. Will you remember to? Absolutely not.

**Q: Is this better than Stack Overflow?**  
A: No. Nothing is better than Stack Overflow. This is just Stack Overflow with extra steps.

**Q: How many snippets should I save?**  
A: However many it takes before you realize you're just procrastinating.

## Known Issues (Features?)

- No backup system (RIP your data)
- No cloud sync (it's 2025 and we're using LocalStorage)
- No export reminders (you'll forget)
- No undo button (live with your choices)
- No snippet categories (because who actually organizes things)
- The search works too well (now you can find all the garbage you saved)

---

## Warning Signs You Have a Problem

- You have more snippets than actual projects
- You've saved 3 different versions of the same function
- You search "that map thing" at least weekly
- You've lost snippets to browser cache wipes more than once
- You're reading this README for a snippet manager you'll barely use

---

## Contributing

Want to add features? Sure. Just know that:
- Nobody will use them
- They'll increase the snippet hoarding problem
- The app will still lose all data when someone clears their cache
- But hey, at least you'll learn something

Keep PRs simple. No frameworks. No over-engineering. This is a snippet manager, not a enterprise solution.

---

## Future Updates (In My Dreams)

- [ ] Cloud backup (so you can lose your data in the cloud too)
- [ ] Snippet sharing (spread the hoarding disease)
- [ ] AI suggestions (because we don't have enough AI features)
- [ ] Browser extension (invade more of your workflow)
- [ ] Dark mode toggle (to light mode nobody will use)
- [ ] A "You have 200 unused snippets" shame notification

---

## License

MIT - Copy it, modify it, use it to hoard your own code snippets. When it inevitably fails you, at least you can't sue me. 🤷

---

## Final Thoughts

Look, we all know how this ends:

1. You'll save 50 snippets in the first week
2. You'll use 2 of them
3. You'll forget this app exists
4. You'll clear your browser cache
5. You'll lose everything
6. You'll Google the same solutions again
7. The cycle continues

But sure, go ahead. Save that snippet. I'm sure *this time* you'll remember to export your data.

**Built with delusion and LocalStorage** by Abhiraj Dixit

**Stack:** HTML, CSS, JS, and broken promises  
**Tested by:** People who definitely won't export their data  
**Recommended for:** Developers who enjoy pain  
**Not recommended for:** People with functioning memory  

*"It's like bookmarks, but worse!"* - Every user, probably

### Real Talk

This app won't make you more organized. It won't make you remember where you saved that function. It won't stop you from Googling the same thing every week.

But it's free, it works, and it's better than digging through 500 untitled.txt files.

So here we are. Living our best developer lives. One snippet at a time. 💀

**Now go hoard some code like the digital pack rat you are.** 📦
